All the files highlighted under Add files via upload is a part of folder called "client", which I don't know why github was restricting me to push. 

All the files have been uploaded accuractely with working effectively just one folder isn't uploaded which is "node-modules". 
Which I'll provide you a drive link for that. 


I will also provide the entire project files drive link. So you can also download the project files from the drive link. 

Thanks and Happy Learning!
